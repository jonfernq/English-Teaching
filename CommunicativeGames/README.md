## Communicative Games

English teacher Jill Hadfield popularized the idea of 'communication games' is a series of photocopiable teaching materials books 
she published beginning in the 1980s. 

### Typology of Activities 

- **Information gap**: activities are a common approach to English language learning that involves providing students with tasks or challenges that require them to acquire new information in order to be successful. These activities typically involve a scenario in which one student (Student A) possesses information that the other student (Student B) does not, and Student B must gather that information in order to complete the task or solve the problem. Information gap activities may be one-sided or reciprocal, and can be played in pairs or small groups, with each member of the group possessing some unique piece of information.

- **Guessing games** are a common type of activity in which one player possesses information that they intentionally withhold, while other players attempt to guess what that information might be. This approach is based on the same principle as information gap activities, but involves an element of guesswork and speculation.

- **Search games** are a type of activity in which the entire class participates, with each student possessing a single piece of information. The objective of the game is for players to gather as much information as possible in order to complete a questionnaire or solve a problem. Unlike information gap and guessing games, search games involve all members of the class in a collaborative effort to collect and share information, with each student acting as both a giver and collector of information.

- **Matching games** are a type of activity that involve a transfer of information through matching identical pairs of cards or pictures. Unlike information gap, guessing, and search games, matching games are based on a different principle. They may be played as a whole class activity, where everyone must circulate until they find a partner with the same card or picture, or as a pair work or small group activity, where players must choose pictures or cards from a selection to match those chosen by their partner from the same selection. Alternatively, they may be played as a card game based on the 'snap' principle.

- **Matching-up games** are activities that operate on the jigsaw principle, where each member of a group possesses a list of opinions or preferences, only one of which is shared by everyone in the group. The objective of the game is for the group to reach a consensus on a common preference through discussion. This consensus is then used to make a decision, such as choosing a dinner date or an afternoon activity. Unlike matching games that involve matching identical pairs of cards or pictures, matching-up games require group discussion and collaboration to arrive at a shared decision.
  
- **Exchanging and collecting games** are activities that operate on the 'barter' principle, where players possess certain articles or cards that they are willing to exchange for others in order to complete a set. These games may be played as a whole class activity, where players freely circulate and exchange cards or articles at random, or as an inter-group activity, where players agree to collect a certain set of articles as a group and then exchange articles between groups. Alternatively, they may be played as a card game based on the 'rummy' principle. Unlike matching-up games that require group collaboration to arrive at a shared decision, exchanging and collecting games involve individual players seeking to complete a specific set of articles or cards.  

- **Combining activities** are activities in which players are required to act on certain information to group themselves in various ways, such as forming families or groups of people living in the same flat. Unlike other language learning activities that involve the transfer or exchange of information, combining activities involve players using the information they possess to organize themselves into specific groups or arrangements.

#### 39. Robert's busy day
- **Activity Type:** Information Gap

The activity is called "Robert's busy day" and it is a communicative language learning activity that employs an information gap to get students exchanging information. The objective of the game is to fill in all the diary entries of Robert's diary.

Each student receives a page of Robert's diary with some entries missing. They must move around the class and ask other students questions such as "What is he doing/did he do at... o'clock?" to obtain the missing information. Students may pass on the information they have obtained from other students as well as the information that was originally on their page.

For example, a student might ask "What did Robert do at 9 o'clock?" and another student might respond "He had coffee with a friend." The first student can then write that information in their diary entry for 9 o'clock.

The activity focuses on practicing the language function of asking and talking about future arrangements or past events and the lexical area of social activities. Essential vocabulary includes catch, have (coffee/a drink/lunch/tea), meet, and go to.

A similar game may be played using information about the students' own activities of the previous day or their arrangements for the next day. Students can write a short account of their activities and use the information to prepare a short questionnaire to interview each other and find the answers to the questions.

Overall, the activity promotes communication and collaboration between students while practicing language skills in a fun and interactive way.
