Playing the game of 20 questions in a Thai high school classroom can be an engaging way to learn vocabulary. Here's a suggested approach for playing the game with teams:

1. Divide the class into two or more teams. Each team should have an equal number of students.
    
2. Choose a vocabulary word or phrase that the teams will try to guess. You can either assign one student from each team to be the "answerer" who knows the word, or you can have a designated answerer for the entire class.
    
3. The answerer should privately communicate the chosen word or phrase to the teacher, who will serve as the game moderator.
    
4. The teacher announces that the game is about to begin and explains the rules to the students. The objective is for the teams to guess the chosen word or phrase within 20 questions.
    
5. The first team begins by asking a yes-or-no question about the word or phrase. For example, "Is it an animal?" or "Is it a food?"
    
6. The moderator responds with a simple "Yes" or "No" answer. If the answer is "Yes," the team can continue asking questions to narrow down the possibilities. If the answer is "No," it moves on to the next team.
    
7. Teams take turns asking questions until a team feels confident enough to guess the word or phrase. If they guess correctly, they earn a point. If they guess incorrectly, they lose their turn, and the game continues with the other teams.
    
8. The game continues until one team reaches the predetermined point limit or until all teams have had an equal number of turns.
    
9. At the end of the game, the team with the highest score wins.
    

To make the game more educational, you can select vocabulary words or phrases that align with the students' current lessons or language proficiency level. Additionally, you can encourage students to ask questions in Thai to practice their language skills while playing the game.
