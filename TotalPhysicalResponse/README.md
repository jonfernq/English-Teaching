## Total Physical Response (TPR) 

- ['Simon Says' Game](https://github.com/jonfernq/English-Teaching/blob/main/TotalPhysicalResponse/SimonSays.md)

The TPR method was developed by Dr. James J. Asher in the 1960s as an approach to teaching second languages. It emphasizes the connection between language and physical movement, aiming to engage learners in a kinesthetic and interactive learning experience.

In TPR, the teacher provides commands or instructions in the target language, and the learners respond by performing physical actions or movements that correspond to those instructions. This method is based on the idea that by associating language with physical actions, learners can better internalize vocabulary and sentence structures.

Some key principles and techniques commonly associated with TPR include:

1. Comprehension before production: TPR focuses on developing listening comprehension skills before requiring learners to produce the language actively.
2. Gesture and action-based learning: Physical gestures, movements, and actions are used to demonstrate meaning and aid comprehension.
3. Classroom commands: The teacher gives commands in the target language, and students respond physically to demonstrate understanding.
4. Teacher modeling: The teacher models the actions and language first, and then students imitate.
5. Low-anxiety environment: TPR aims to create a low-stress learning environment, allowing learners to acquire language naturally and comfortably.
6. Repetition and reinforcement: Frequent repetition of commands and actions helps reinforce vocabulary and language structures.

TPR is often used in the early stages of language learning or with young learners, but it can be adapted for learners of various ages and proficiency levels. It can be an effective method for introducing new vocabulary, practicing grammar structures, and developing listening skills in a dynamic and interactive way.

> Could you elaborate on: Week 1: Introduction to TPR and Classroom Commands? 

Here's a more detailed breakdown of Week 1, focusing on the introduction to TPR and classroom commands:

**Week 1: Introduction to TPR and Classroom Commands** 

Objective:

* Understand the principles and benefits of TPR.
* Introduce basic classroom commands and corresponding actions.
* Practice following commands and responding with appropriate physical actions.

Lesson 1:

* Introduction to TPR: Explain the concept of Total Physical Response (TPR) to the students. Discuss how TPR utilizes physical actions and movement to enhance language learning and comprehension.
* Benefits of TPR: Highlight the advantages of TPR, such as improved vocabulary retention, enhanced listening skills, and reduced language anxiety.
* Demonstration: Provide a live demonstration of TPR by giving commands and demonstrating the corresponding physical actions. For example, give commands like "Stand up," "Sit down," "Raise your hand," and perform the actions as you say them.

Lesson 2:

* Classroom Commands: Introduce a set of basic classroom commands and their meanings. Some examples include "Stand up," "Sit down," "Open your book," "Close your book," "Turn to page \[X\]," "Listen," "Repeat," "Write," etc. Write down the commands on the board along with their corresponding actions.
* Vocabulary Building: Review the vocabulary associated with the commands. Ensure students understand the meaning of each word and its relevance to the commands. Use visual aids or gestures to reinforce comprehension.
* Interactive Practice: Engage the students in a series of interactive practice activities. Begin by giving commands, and students respond with the appropriate physical actions. Gradually increase the complexity of the commands as students become more comfortable.

Lesson 3:

* Reinforcement Activities: Divide the class into pairs or small groups. Have one student give a command, and the other student(s) perform the corresponding action. Encourage students to take turns being the "command giver" and the "command follower."
* Speed Challenge: Create a fast-paced activity where the teacher or a student randomly gives commands, and students must respond with the appropriate actions as quickly as possible. This activity helps improve response time and reinforces vocabulary.

Lesson 4:

* Review and Assessment: Review the commands and their corresponding actions. Conduct a short assessment where students take turns being the "command giver" and the "command follower" in front of the class. Assess their comprehension and accuracy in following commands.

Homework: Assign a small homework task where students practice giving commands to family members or friends at home. Encourage them to explain the meaning of the commands and demonstrate the corresponding actions.

By the end of Week 1, students should have a clear understanding of TPR, be familiar with basic classroom commands, and demonstrate the ability to follow commands and respond with appropriate physical actions.

> Please provide some examples of 'a series of interactive practice activities' mentioned above

Here are some examples of interactive practice activities for students to reinforce their understanding of classroom commands and corresponding actions:

1. Command Chain: Form a circle with the students. Start by giving a command and performing the corresponding action. The student to your right then gives a new command to the next student, who performs the action, and so on. The chain continues until all students have had a chance to give a command and perform an action.
    
2. Simon Says: Play a classic game of "Simon Says" using classroom commands. Begin by saying "Simon says" followed by a command and performing the action. Students must only perform the action if you start with "Simon says." If you give a command without saying "Simon says" and a student still performs the action, they are out. Continue until one student remains.
    
3. Action Cards: Prepare a set of cards with classroom commands written on them. Place the cards face down on a table. Each student takes turns picking a card and giving the command to another student, who must then perform the action. Rotate turns until all the cards have been used.
    
4. Command Charades: Similar to traditional charades, students take turns acting out the commands without speaking, while others try to guess the correct action. This activity encourages students to rely on their comprehension of the commands and demonstrate the actions effectively.
    
5. Find Your Match: Prepare two sets of cards, one with commands and the other with corresponding actions. Shuffle the cards separately and distribute one card to each student. Students must then find their match by locating the student with the matching command or action. Once matched, they perform the action together.
    
6. Command Relay Race: Divide the class into teams. Place a set of command cards at one end of the room and have one student from each team line up at the other end. When you call out a command, the first student from each team races to the command cards, finds the corresponding action, and returns to their team, performing the action. The next student in line then races to complete the next command, and the cycle continues until all commands have been completed.
    

These interactive activities encourage active participation, listening comprehension, and quick response while reinforcing the vocabulary and actions associated with classroom commands. Feel free to adapt these activities or create variations that suit your students' preferences and the learning environment.
