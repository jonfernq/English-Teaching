## Total Physical Response (TPR) Games

> What are some additional Total Physical Response games like Simon Says that can be played with classrooms of Thai English students ?

Here are some additional Total Physical Response (TPR) games that can be played with classrooms of Thai English students:

1. Action Charades: In this game, students take turns acting out different actions silently while their classmates guess what they're doing. For example, a student might mime brushing their teeth, jumping rope, or playing soccer. This game helps students reinforce vocabulary and practice comprehension through gestures.
    
2. Follow the Leader: Choose one student to be the leader and have them perform a series of actions. The rest of the class must follow along and mimic the leader's actions. Encourage the leader to incorporate both simple and more complex movements, such as hopping, skipping, clapping, or doing jumping jacks.
    
3. Body Parts Simon Says: Similar to the traditional Simon Says game, but with a focus on body parts. The teacher or designated student gives instructions such as "Touch your nose" or "Raise your left hand." Students should only perform the action if it's preceded by "Simon says." This game helps students practice body part vocabulary and listening comprehension.
    
4. Freeze Dance: Play some energetic music and have the students dance freely. When the music stops, they must freeze in whatever position they're in. The teacher can also call out different body parts or actions, and students must freeze in a corresponding pose. For example, "Freeze with one hand on your head" or "Freeze like a tree."
    
5. Body Pantomime: Assign each student a body part and have them come to the front of the class one by one. Without speaking, they must use gestures and movements to convey the function or action associated with that body part. For instance, a student assigned "legs" might mime walking or running.
    
6. Simon Says Storytelling: Create a story by giving simple instructions in a sequence, using Simon Says to ensure comprehension. For example, "Simon says stand up. Simon says walk to the door. Simon says open the door. Simon says go outside." Continue the story by adding more actions, allowing students to physically act out the narrative.
    
7. TPR Vocabulary Race: Divide the class into two teams. The teacher calls out a vocabulary word, and one student from each team races to perform the corresponding action. For instance, if the word is "jump," the students must both jump as quickly as possible. The first student to complete the action earns a point for their team.
    
8. Sports Charades: Write the names of different sports on small slips of paper and place them in a container. One student comes forward and randomly selects a slip, without showing it to anyone. They must then act out the sport while the rest of the class tries to guess what it is. This game reinforces sports vocabulary and encourages active participation.
    
Remember to adapt these games to suit the age and proficiency level of your Thai English students. TPR games can be a fun and effective way to engage students, promote physical movement, and reinforce English language learning.

> What are some additional Total Physical Response games not like Simon Says that can be played with classrooms of Thai English students ?

Here are some additional Total Physical Response (TPR) games that are not like Simon Says, but can be played with classrooms of Thai English students:

1. Vocabulary Relay: Divide the class into teams and set up two lines, one for each team. Place vocabulary flashcards or word cards at the front of the classroom. The first student from each team runs to the front, picks up a card, and performs the action associated with the word. They then run back and tag the next person in line. The relay continues until all the cards have been used. This game helps reinforce vocabulary and encourages teamwork.
    
2. Mime Match: Prepare a set of vocabulary cards with verbs, nouns, or adjectives. Each student takes a turn drawing a card and silently acting out the word using gestures and body movements. The rest of the class tries to guess the word. Encourage students to be creative and expressive in their miming.
    
3. Body Alphabet: Have students form a circle and take turns going through the alphabet. Each student says a letter and an associated body part that starts with that letter. For example, "A is for arm," "B is for back," and so on. Students must remember the previous letters and body parts while adding their own. This game helps reinforce the alphabet and body part vocabulary.
    
4. Dance-Off: Divide the class into smaller groups. Each group creates a short dance routine using a specific set of vocabulary words or phrases. They can incorporate movements, gestures, and even simple choreography. After practicing, each group performs their dance in front of the class. Encourage creativity and enthusiasm while reinforcing vocabulary.
    
5. TPR Story Chain: Start by telling a simple story using TPR, incorporating gestures and actions to accompany the narrative. Then, pass the storytelling responsibility to a student who continues the story using TPR. The story chain continues, with each student adding a few sentences to the story using gestures and actions. This game encourages storytelling skills, creativity, and active participation.
    
6. Picture Dictation: Prepare a series of simple drawings or visual scenes related to vocabulary themes. Describe each picture using English sentences, and students must interpret the description and draw the corresponding image. For example, "Draw a circle in the middle of the page. Add two dots inside for eyes. Draw a curved line for the mouth." This game helps reinforce listening comprehension and vocabulary while engaging students in a hands-on activity.
    
7. Body Parts Memory: Arrange students in a circle. Start by saying, "I went to the market and I bought an apple." The next student continues, adding an item and miming the action associated with it. For example, "I went to the market and I bought an apple and a soccer ball." Each student must recall and repeat the previous items before adding their own. This game challenges memory recall and encourages full-body engagement.
    
8. Action Storytime: Choose a simple story or a short passage from a book and assign specific actions or gestures to key words or phrases. As you read the story aloud, the students must listen attentively and perform the corresponding actions whenever they hear the designated words. This game combines listening comprehension with physical movement.
    
TPR games provide an interactive and engaging way to reinforce vocabulary, improve comprehension, and promote physical activity in the classroom.

> Please list some Total Physical Response games and activities for teaching Thai English students how to  give directions 

Here are some Total Physical Response (TPR) games and activities for teaching Thai English students how to give directions:

1. Human Map: Create a large map on the floor using tape or markers. Assign different locations, such as a park, school, supermarket, etc. Divide the class into pairs or small groups. One student in each group acts as the "guide" and gives directions to their partner to reach a specific location on the map. The partner must follow the given directions and move to the correct destination. Rotate roles within the group so that each student gets a chance to give and follow directions.
    
2. Direction Simon Says: Play a variation of Simon Says focused on giving directions. Choose one student to be "Simon." Simon gives directions, such as "Simon says take three steps forward" or "Simon says turn left." The rest of the class must follow the directions. If Simon gives a direction without saying "Simon says" first, students should not perform the action. This game helps students practice listening comprehension and following directions.
    
3. Map Drawing: Provide each student with a simple map or grid paper. Instruct them to draw a map of their classroom or a familiar location. Students must include important landmarks and label them. Then, students take turns giving directions to their partner to navigate through their map. For example, "Go straight ahead, turn right at the first intersection, and the library is on your left." This activity reinforces map reading skills and giving clear directions.
    
4. Treasure Hunt: Create a treasure hunt activity by hiding objects or pictures around the classroom or designated area. Divide the class into small groups and give each group a set of clues or directions written in English. The students must read and follow the directions to find the hidden treasures. Encourage students to take turns giving directions within their group.
    
5. Direction Relay Race: Set up a course with different stations or checkpoints in the classroom or outdoor area. Divide the class into teams and have each team line up at the starting point. Give the first student from each team a set of directions to reach the first station. They must run to the station, follow the given directions, and return to their team to tag the next student. The relay continues until all students have completed the course. This game reinforces giving and following directions under time pressure.
    
6. Build a Lego City: Provide each student or group with a set of Lego blocks and a picture or plan of a city or structure. The students must work together to build the city according to the plan, following the given directions and coordinating their efforts. Encourage students to use directional language, such as "Place the red block on top of the blue block" or "Connect the yellow block to the green block."
    
7. Direction Dictation: Give each student a blank sheet of paper and provide verbal directions in English for them to follow. For example, "Draw a circle in the center of the paper. Next, draw a square below the circle. Then, draw a line from the top of the page to the bottom." Students must listen carefully and follow the directions accurately. This activity helps develop listening skills and following multi-step directions.
    
8. Role-play: Divide the class into pairs or small groups. Assign roles such as a lost tourist and a helpful local. The tourist must ask for directions to a specific location, and the local must give clear directions in English. Encourage students to use common directional vocabulary, such as "turn left," "go straight," "cross the street," etc. Rotate roles within the pairs or groups to practice both giving and receiving directions.
    

These TPR games and activities provide interactive and hands-on opportunities for Thai English students to practice giving and following directions in English. They help reinforce vocabulary, listening skills, and spatial awareness while making learning enjoyable
