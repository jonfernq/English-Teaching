## Task-Based Learning (TBL)

Task-based learning (TBL) is an approach to language learning that emphasizes the use of authentic language in meaningful tasks or activities. The idea behind TBL is that learners are more motivated to learn and retain new language when they are engaged in tasks that are relevant to their lives and interests.

In TBL, learners work on tasks that require them to use language to achieve a specific goal or objective. These tasks can be anything from planning a trip to negotiating a business deal. Learners are encouraged to use language in a natural, communicative way, and are given opportunities to practice and receive feedback on their language use.

TBL is often contrasted with more traditional language teaching approaches that focus on grammar and vocabulary instruction. In TBL, the emphasis is on using language in real-world contexts, with grammar and vocabulary instruction taking a secondary role as needed to support the task at hand.

Overall, TBL is a learner-centered approach that aims to develop learners' communicative competence and language proficiency through engaging, meaningful tasks.

> Do you know Jane Willis' A Framework for Task-Based Learning ? 

Yes, I am familiar with Jane Willis' "A Framework for Task-Based Learning" (Longman, 1996). It is a well-known book that presents a systematic approach to designing and implementing task-based language teaching (TBLT) programs.

The framework is based on five key components: task cycle, language focus, language skills, task types, and task planning. Each component is described in detail and illustrated with examples and activities.

Willis' framework has been widely used and adapted by language teachers and researchers around the world. It is considered a seminal work in the field of TBLT and has contributed to the development of task-based approaches to language teaching and learning.

> According to this book, what are the 'components of the task cycle' ? 

According to Jane Willis' "A Framework for Task-Based Learning", the components of the task cycle are as follows:

- **Pre-task:** This is the stage in which the teacher introduces the topic and prepares the learners for the task. The pre-task stage may include activities such as brainstorming, vocabulary work, and discussion.

- **Task cycle:** This is the core of the framework, and it involves the learners performing the task. The task should be designed to be communicative and should require the learners to use the target language in a meaningful way. The task cycle typically consists of three phases:

a. Task planning: In this phase, the learners plan how they will complete the task, including deciding who will do what, and how they will use the target language.

b. Task performance: This is the stage in which the learners carry out the task.

c. Task evaluation: After completing the task, the learners evaluate their performance and reflect on what they have learned.

**Language focus:** This is the stage in which the teacher provides explicit instruction on specific language points that arose during the task cycle. The language focus stage may include activities such as grammar and vocabulary instruction, error correction, and feedback.

**Follow-up:** This is the final stage of the task cycle, and it involves consolidating and extending the learners' learning. The follow-up stage may include activities such as reflection, review, and further practice.

These components are designed to be cyclical and to encourage a focus on communication and interaction.

> What is the typical durations of these components or steps in the lesson? 

The duration of each component in the task cycle may vary depending on factors such as the level of learners, the complexity of the task, and the time available for the lesson. However, as a general guideline, the following durations are suggested by Jane Willis in her book "A Framework for Task-Based Learning":

**Task planning:** This component involves introducing the task and providing learners with any necessary instructions or materials. The duration of this component may vary depending on the complexity of the task, but it typically takes 5-10 minutes.

**Pre-task activities:** These are activities that help to prepare learners for the task by activating their prior knowledge or introducing new vocabulary or structures that will be needed for the task. The duration of this component may vary depending on the level of learners and the complexity of the task, but it typically takes 10-15 minutes.

**Task cycle:** This is the main component of the lesson, during which learners work on the task in pairs or small groups. The duration of this component may vary depending on the level of learners and the complexity of the task, but it typically takes 20-30 minutes.

**Language focus:** This component involves a focus on the language that emerged during the task cycle, either through feedback from the teacher or self-correction by the learners. The duration of this component may vary depending on the language needs of the learners, but it typically takes 10-15 minutes.

**Task evaluation:** This component involves reflecting on the task and the language that was used, and providing learners with feedback on their performance. The duration of this component may vary depending on the complexity of the task and the level of learners, but it typically takes 5-10 minutes.

> So to make a formal form to fill out for a task-based learning lesson, what fields would be included, what information would be required ?  

To create a formal form for a task-based learning lesson, the following fields could be included:

Title of the task
Task overview: a brief description of the task, its purpose and expected outcome
Task cycle components: a list of the components of the task cycle, including:
Pre-task: activities or questions to introduce the topic and prepare students for the task
Task cycle: the task itself and the follow-up activities
Task: the main activity or project that students will work on
Planning: time for students to plan their task
Report: time for students to report back on their task to the class
Analysis: time for the teacher and students to analyze and evaluate the task and language used
Language focus: a section to outline any specific language points or skills that will be focused on during the task
Assessment: a brief explanation of how the task will be assessed or evaluated
Materials and resources: a list of any materials or resources needed for the task, such as handouts, videos, or equipment
Timing: an estimate of the time required for each component of the task cycle, as well as the total time for the lesson
Teacher notes: any additional notes or instructions for the teacher, such as tips for facilitating the task or suggestions for modifications based on student level or ability.

By completing this form, teachers can plan and organize their task-based lessons more effectively and ensure that all necessary components are included.

> Present - Practice - Produce is a common paradigm for lesson-planning, what other paradigms are there ? 

There are many other paradigms for lesson planning in language teaching besides Present-Practice-Produce (PPP). Some other popular approaches include:

**Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT):* This approach focuses on setting tasks for students to complete, which are designed to help them develop their language skills while also achieving a goal.

**Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL):** This approach involves teaching subject content (e.g., science, history) through the medium of a second language, with the aim of developing both language and content knowledge.

**The Lexical Approach:** This approach emphasizes the importance of teaching vocabulary in context, and views vocabulary as the building blocks of language.

**The Communicative Approach:** This approach focuses on developing students' ability to communicate effectively in real-life situations, and emphasizes the importance of interaction and negotiation of meaning.

**The Audio-Lingual Method:** This approach focuses on drilling students in the patterns and structures of the language through repetitive practice and the use of dialogues.

**The Silent Way:** This approach involves the teacher being largely silent during the lesson, with the aim of encouraging students to take an active role in their own learning.

**The Suggestopedia Method:** This approach involves creating a relaxed and positive learning environment, and using music and other creative techniques to help students learn in a stress-free way.

These are just a few examples of the many different paradigms for language teaching that exist.

> Please compare Present - Practice - Produce with the steps of a Task-Based Learning lesson. 

The Present-Practice-Produce (PPP) approach and the Task-Based Learning (TBL) approach are both popular paradigms for lesson planning in language teaching.

The PPP approach involves the following steps:

**Present:** The teacher presents new language items (e.g., vocabulary, grammar structures, etc.) to the students.

**Practice:** The students practice using the new language items in a controlled environment, such as drills or exercises.

**Produce:** The students produce language using the new items in a freer, less controlled environment, such as conversation or writing.

In contrast, the TBL approach involves the following steps:

**Pre-task:** The teacher introduces a task to the students, such as solving a problem, making a plan, or completing a project. The task should be authentic, meaning it should simulate a real-world situation that the students might encounter outside the classroom.

**Task cycle:** The students work in pairs or groups to complete the task. The teacher monitors and provides feedback as needed.

**Language focus:** After the task is completed, the teacher focuses on specific language items that were used or needed during the task. This might include vocabulary, grammar, or pronunciation.

**Reflection:** The students reflect on the task and the language used during the task. They might discuss what they learned, what challenges they faced, and what they could do differently next time.

Compared to the PPP approach, the TBL approach is more student-centered and focuses on developing communicative competence in real-world contexts. The PPP approach, on the other hand, is more teacher-centered and focuses on presenting and practicing new language items.

### TBL Resources 

> So Elementary Communication Games by Jill Hadfield provides many tbl tasks for different language functions, do you know where there is a large collection or compendium of TBL tasks? 

There are several resources available that provide a large collection of task-based learning (TBL) activities for different language functions. Here are a few examples:

The book "Task-Based Language Teaching: A Practical Approach" by David Nunan provides a comprehensive guide to TBL, including a wide range of sample tasks and activities for different language functions.

The website "One Stop English" provides a collection of TBL lesson plans and activities for a variety of language functions, organized by level and topic.

The website "TeachingEnglish" by the British Council offers a range of resources for TBL, including lesson plans, activity ideas, and classroom materials for different language functions.

The book "Task-Based Language Learning and Teaching with Technology" by Michael Thomas and Hayo Reinders provides a collection of TBL activities that incorporate technology, such as online collaboration tools and mobile devices.

The book "Language Learning Tasks: Designing and Implementing Task-Based Language Teaching" by Rod Ellis and Gary Barkhuizen offers a detailed guide to designing and implementing TBL activities for different language functions.

These resources provide a wealth of TBL activities and ideas for teachers and learners looking to incorporate more authentic, communicative language practice into their language learning.

> Worksheets & Printed Materials  

Don't you need worksheets or cards with information on it, to create 'information gaps', to do these tasks, or is it possible to do them without photocopied materials, with just a sheet of A4 paper for instance, or just using the board to describe what to do? 

It is definitely possible to create and carry out task-based learning (TBL) activities without photocopied materials or cards. While such materials can be useful in creating "information gaps" or other challenges for learners to overcome, they are not essential to the TBL approach.

In fact, many TBL activities can be carried out with minimal materials, using just a sheet of paper or the board to describe what to do. For example, a simple TBL activity might involve asking learners to plan a weekend trip with a partner, using only the language they have learned so far in class. The teacher might provide some basic prompts or questions to guide the conversation, but the activity itself can be carried out without any additional materials.

Other TBL activities might involve using real-world materials, such as advertisements, brochures, or news articles, rather than photocopied worksheets or cards. For example, learners might be asked to plan a restaurant meal using a menu, or to create a product advertisement based on a magazine article.

Ultimately, the key to successful TBL is to focus on creating engaging, authentic tasks that challenge learners to use language in meaningful ways. While materials can certainly be helpful in achieving this goal, they are not essential, and teachers can be creative in designing TBL activities that work with the resources available to them.
