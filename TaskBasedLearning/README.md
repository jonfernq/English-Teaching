## Task-Based Learning (TBL)

Task-based learning (TBL) is an approach to language learning that emphasizes the use of authentic language in meaningful tasks or activities. The idea behind TBL is that learners are more motivated to learn and retain new language when they are engaged in tasks that are relevant to their lives and interests.

In TBL, learners work on tasks that require them to use language to achieve a specific goal or objective. These tasks can be anything from planning a trip to negotiating a business deal. Learners are encouraged to use language in a natural, communicative way, and are given opportunities to practice and receive feedback on their language use.

TBL is often contrasted with more traditional language teaching approaches that focus on grammar and vocabulary instruction. In TBL, the emphasis is on using language in real-world contexts, with grammar and vocabulary instruction taking a secondary role as needed to support the task at hand.

Overall, TBL is a learner-centered approach that aims to develop learners' communicative competence and language proficiency through engaging, meaningful tasks.

### Language Functions 

In the context of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), a language function refers to the communicative purpose or intention behind a piece of language. For example, the function of a sentence like "Can you pass the salt?" is to make a request.

The CEFR organizes language functions into six broad categories, which are referred to as "can-do statements." These categories are:

- **Reception:** understanding spoken and written language
- **Production:** speaking and writing
- **Interaction:** participating in spoken and written communication
- **Mediation:** helping others to communicate effectively
- **Language resources:** using grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation effectively
- **Strategies:** using effective learning strategies and managing one's own learning

Each of these categories is further broken down into subcategories, and each subcategory is associated with a specific language function. For example, under the "Production" category, one subcategory is "Spoken production," and some of the associated language functions include giving information, expressing opinions, and making suggestions.

The CEFR uses language functions as a way to describe learners' abilities and progress in a way that is more meaningful and relevant to real-world communication than traditional language proficiency levels. By focusing on what learners can do with language, rather than just what they know, the CEFR aims to provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of language ability.

### TBL Resources 

So Elementary Communication Games by Jill Hadfield provides many tbl tasks for different language functions, do you know where there is a large collection or compendium of tbl tasks? 
There are several resources available that provide a large collection of task-based learning (TBL) activities for different language functions. Here are a few examples:

The book "Task-Based Language Teaching: A Practical Approach" by David Nunan provides a comprehensive guide to TBL, including a wide range of sample tasks and activities for different language functions.

The website "One Stop English" provides a collection of TBL lesson plans and activities for a variety of language functions, organized by level and topic.

The website "TeachingEnglish" by the British Council offers a range of resources for TBL, including lesson plans, activity ideas, and classroom materials for different language functions.

The book "Task-Based Language Learning and Teaching with Technology" by Michael Thomas and Hayo Reinders provides a collection of TBL activities that incorporate technology, such as online collaboration tools and mobile devices.

The book "Language Learning Tasks: Designing and Implementing Task-Based Language Teaching" by Rod Ellis and Gary Barkhuizen offers a detailed guide to designing and implementing TBL activities for different language functions.

These resources provide a wealth of TBL activities and ideas for teachers and learners looking to incorporate more authentic, communicative language practice into their language learning.

> Worksheets & Printed Materials  

Don't you need worksheets or cards with information on it, to create 'information gaps', to do these tasks, or is it possible to do them without photocopied materials, with just a sheet of A$ paper for instance, or just using the board to describe what to do? 

It is definitely possible to create and carry out task-based learning (TBL) activities without photocopied materials or cards. While such materials can be useful in creating "information gaps" or other challenges for learners to overcome, they are not essential to the TBL approach.

In fact, many TBL activities can be carried out with minimal materials, using just a sheet of paper or the board to describe what to do. For example, a simple TBL activity might involve asking learners to plan a weekend trip with a partner, using only the language they have learned so far in class. The teacher might provide some basic prompts or questions to guide the conversation, but the activity itself can be carried out without any additional materials.

Other TBL activities might involve using real-world materials, such as advertisements, brochures, or news articles, rather than photocopied worksheets or cards. For example, learners might be asked to plan a restaurant meal using a menu, or to create a product advertisement based on a magazine article.

Ultimately, the key to successful TBL is to focus on creating engaging, authentic tasks that challenge learners to use language in meaningful ways. While materials can certainly be helpful in achieving this goal, they are not essential, and teachers can be creative in designing TBL activities that work with the resources available to them.
