## Friends from First Meeting

Tom: "So, do you have any friends that you became really close with at the first meeting?"

Bill: "Yeah, actually I have one friend that I met in high school. His name is Robert and he was my classmate and roommate."

Tom: "Oh wow, how did you guys become such good friends so quickly?"

Bill: "Well, we both arrived late on the first day of school and got scolded by the teacher. We started talking and discovered that we had similar hobbies and opinions on things, so we just clicked."

Tom: "That's awesome! What kind of things did you guys like to do together?"

Bill: "We would play basketball at school and often played computer games when we got home. We even helped each other get a girlfriend."

Tom: "Wow, it sounds like you guys were inseparable!"

Bill: "Yeah, we were. Robert is the first and probably the last friend I will make at the first meeting because Iâ€™m actually a shy guy so making friends instantly is unusual for me."
