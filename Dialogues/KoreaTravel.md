**Dialogue:* 

Tom: Have you ever thought about traveling to Korea?

Sue: Yes, ever since I was a little girl, I have always wanted to travel to Korea.

Tom: I've heard that South Korea is very popular among young people in Thailand. They call it the "Korean Wave" or "Hallyu," right?

Sue: Absolutely! South Korean culture, especially K-pop and K-dramas, has a massive following in Thailand. Many young people actively listen to K-pop, follow K-pop groups, and even attend their concerts and events. K-dramas are also incredibly popular among Thai viewers, and we've developed a strong interest in South Korean actors and actresses.

Tom: That sounds amazing! If you were to go, who would you go with?

Sue: I would probably go with a few of my classmates. Holidays can be boring if you travel alone, and it's much safer to travel as a group.

Tom: That's a good point. So, how would you plan your trip?

Sue: Well, I'm not a fan of backpacking, so we would be staying in 4 or 5-star hotels and dining at the best Korean restaurants to experience authentic Korean cuisine.

Tom: That sounds luxurious! What else would you like to do while in Korea?

Sue: Apart from exploring the culture, I can't miss out on shopping! South Korea has many famous designer brands, and you know I'm crazy about fashion. Shopping is definitely a must for me.

Tom: I can understand that. It sounds like a dream holiday, but it might be expensive, right?

Sue: Yes, I know it would be costly, but I hope that one day I can fulfill this dream and make it a reality.

Tom: I believe you can do it! Keep working towards your goal, and I'm sure you'll make it happen.

Sue: Thank you for the encouragement. I'll definitely keep striving to make this dream come true.
