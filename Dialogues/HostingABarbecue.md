### Dialogue 

John: Have you ever had an outdoor barbecue before?

Mike: Actually, I had one last summer at the beach.

John: Oh, that sounds interesting. Why did you choose to have it at the beach?

Mike: My dad is a big fan of American TV dramas and he wanted to have a barbecue like they do on the shows. He chose the beach because there was plenty of space and we could do some fishing too.

John: That's a cool idea. Did you catch anything while you were fishing?

Mike: Unfortunately, I didn't catch anything. I spent two hours next to the fishing rod but didn't catch anything.

John: That's too bad. So, how did you prepare for the barbecue?

Mike: We bought the cooking equipment and a lot of meat. My dad even practiced making burgers at home so he wouldn't mess up on the day of the barbecue. We also called our friends about a month in advance to invite them.

John: That sounds like a lot of work. Did your friends bring anything to the barbecue?

Mike: Yeah, most people brought a plate of food or drinks, including alcohol. We had a variety of food and drinks.

John: That sounds like it was a successful event. Are you planning on having another barbecue this summer?

Mike: Yes, I am. I'm thinking about asking a girl from my class to come and if the party is successful, I might even ask her out.

John: Good luck with that. I hope the party is a success!
