## Lending money to a friend

**Have you ever lent money to a friend? Should you do this? What if they don't pay it back?**


### Dialogue: 

Susan: Hey, have you ever lent money to a friend before?

Elizabeth: Yeah, I did once, but it didn't turn out well. Why do you ask?

Susan: I lent my friend 3000 baht and she never paid me back. I regret it so much.

Elizabeth: That's terrible. Did you ask her why she needed the money?

Susan: Yeah, I did, but she wouldn't tell me. I trusted her since we have been friends for a long time, but it turned out she used the money just to buy clothes. It wasn't really an emergency. 

Elizabeth: That's really disappointing. Did you try to talk to her about it?

Susan: I did. I asked her to pay me back, but she refused and stopped answering my calls.

Elizabeth: I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can learn from this experience and be more careful in the future when it comes to lending money to friends.

Susan: Yeah, I definitely learned my lesson. I don't think I will be lending money to friends anymore.

Elizabeth: It's understandable. Losing money and a friend at the same time is definitely not worth it.
