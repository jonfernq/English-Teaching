## I spend all my time in the kitchen 

**What room in your home do you spend the most time in?** 


### Dialogue 

Mary: Which room do you spend most of your time in at home?

Annie: Surprisingly, it's the kitchen.

Mary: Really? Why is that?

Annie: Well, my kitchen is equipped with the latest and most sophisticated cooking tools, including a microwave oven that can even barbecue meat or make stew. Plus, it's quite big compared to other kitchens, about 40 square meters.

Mary: Wow, that's impressive. So, what kind of food do you like to cook?

Annie: My kitchen is actually divided into two sections, one for making Chinese food and the other for western food. But my forte is Italian food. I had a neighbor from Italy who was a chef at a 5-star hotel and she would often invite me over for dinner. I learned a lot from her and even how to wash dishes properly.

Mary: That's cool. Why do you spend so much time in the kitchen?

Annie: Well, I lost confidence in the restaurants around my home. The food isn't really tasty and there are a lot of problems with oil and hygiene in many restaurants around China. So, I experiment with recipes I find online and my parents come home to delicious food.

Mary: That sounds great. Have you been cooking during this exam period?

Annie: No, unfortunately, I had to eat at restaurants the past few days since I'm from Ningbo. I miss my kitchen and my own cooking a little.
