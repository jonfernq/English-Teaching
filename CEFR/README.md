## Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR)

> What is the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) ? 

  The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) is a framework for describing language ability in a way that is consistent and recognized across Europe. It was developed by the Council of Europe and is widely used in language education, testing, and assessment.

The CEFR divides language ability into six levels, from A1 (beginner) to C2 (proficient). Each level is described in terms of what a learner can do in the language, rather than just their knowledge of grammar and vocabulary. For example, at the A1 level, a learner can understand and use basic phrases and expressions related to everyday situations, while at the C2 level, a learner can understand and express complex ideas and opinions fluently and accurately.

The CEFR is used by language schools, language testing organizations, and employers to assess and compare language ability across different contexts and countries. It is also used by language learners as a guide to set goals and track their progress in learning a new language.

> There seem to be three books that provide detailed spefications of levels: Waystage (A2), Threshold (B1), and Vantage (B2). Are there detailed specifications of all levels  in some website or publication? 

  Yes, in addition to the three levels you mentioned, the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) provides detailed descriptions and specifications for all six levels of language proficiency (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2).

These descriptions and specifications can be found in the official CEFR publication, which is available for free download on the Council of Europe's website. The publication provides a detailed description of what learners can do at each level in terms of their ability to understand and use the language in different contexts, such as socializing, work, and academic settings. It also includes a range of examples and illustrative descriptors to help learners and teachers understand what language ability looks like at each level.

In addition to the official CEFR publication, there are also many resources available online that provide detailed information about the CEFR levels and how they are used in language learning and assessment. These resources can be helpful for language learners, teachers, and assessment providers who want to better understand the CEFR and how it can be used to assess and compare language ability across different contexts and countries.

What is the name of the official CEFR publication that you refer to above? 

The official CEFR publication is called the "Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, teaching, assessment" and is commonly known as the "CEFR" or "CEFR document". It was first published by the Council of Europe in 2001 and has since been revised and updated. The latest version was published in 2018 and is available for free download on the Council of Europe's website.

> Most textbooks use a level classification system such as Starter, Beginner, Lower Intermediate, Intermediate, Advanced Intermediate, Advanced... How does the CEFR level system map onto this ? 

The CEFR level system can be mapped onto the common textbook level classification system as follows:

- A1: Starter, Beginner
- A2: Lower Intermediate
- B1: Intermediate
- B2: Advanced Intermediate, Upper Intermediate
- C1: Advanced
- C2: Proficient

It's worth noting, however, that the CEFR system is more precise and detailed than the common textbook level classification system, as it provides a more fine-grained description of what learners can do at each level in terms of their ability to understand and use the language in different contexts. Additionally, the CEFR is recognized and used internationally, whereas the textbook level classification system may vary by country and publisher.

> Is it possible to use the standard to objectively assess the level of different reading passages or language learning tasks and questions? Can one do this with Python? 

Yes, it is possible to use the CEFR to objectively assess the level of different reading passages or language learning tasks and questions. This can be done by analyzing the text or task against the descriptors provided in the CEFR for each level, and assigning a level based on the closest match.

There are various ways to do this using Python, depending on the specific task and level of analysis required. Some possible approaches include:

- Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the vocabulary, syntax, and complexity of the text or task, and compare it to the CEFR descriptors for each level. This can be done using Python libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, or TextBlob.
- Using machine learning algorithms to classify the text or task into one of the CEFR levels based on features such as word frequency, sentence length, or readability scores. This can be done using Python libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Keras.
- Using rule-based approaches to analyze the text or task against the CEFR descriptors for each level, based on criteria such as the type of language used, the complexity of ideas, or the level of inference required. This can be done using Python libraries such as rule-based engines or expert systems.

  It's worth noting that while these approaches can provide a rough estimate of the level of a given text or task, they are not always accurate or reliable, and may need to be combined with human judgment and interpretation. Additionally, the CEFR is intended to be used as a flexible framework for describing language proficiency, and should not be used as a rigid benchmark or standard for all language learning tasks and contexts.

> Are there any Python packages available for this purpose? 

Yes, there are Python packages available for assessing the level of text or language learning tasks according to the CEFR. Here are a few examples:

- CEFRank: a Python package for estimating the CEFR level of texts based on statistical analysis of features such as word frequency, sentence length, and complexity. It uses a machine learning model trained on a corpus of CEFR-aligned texts to make predictions. CEFRank is available on PyPI and GitHub.

- CEFR-ML: a Python package for automatically annotating language learning materials with CEFR levels. It uses a machine learning approach based on support vector machines (SVMs) to classify tasks according to the CEFR descriptors. CEFR-ML is available on GitHub.

- CEFR-annotator: a Python package for manually annotating texts or tasks with CEFR levels using a simple web interface. It allows multiple annotators to collaborate and compare their annotations, and provides basic analytics and visualization tools. CEFR-annotator is available on GitHub.

It's worth noting that these packages may require some customization or adaptation to work with specific languages or domains, and should be used with caution and critical evaluation. Additionally, the results obtained from these tools should be interpreted as indicative rather than definitive, and should not be used as the sole basis for language learning assessment or evaluation.
